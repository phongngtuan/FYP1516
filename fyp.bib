    abstract={Efficient and scalable simultaneous interaction between many web servers requires special handling of such
        interaction. Google Datastore provides highly available and reliable distributed storage and access on different
            types of data. With the rapid growth of distributed systems, efficient data provide is of critical
            importance. In this paper we present the possibilities which Google Application Engine and cloud computing
            provides to build distributed applications by specifically discussing the options to store the data on the
            cloud in a reliable way. Important is identification of the programming languages and tools which are
            suitable for designing of distributed systems using the Google possibilities as a framework for developing
            such systems. The design of distributed systems by using Google features together with the libraries in Java
            and Python programming language are examined in this paper.},

            presented to combine the short-range wireless communication technology Zigbee and the long-range wireless
            communication technology GPRS to monitor human health. This system can not only meet the main requirement of
            real-time monitoring, but also avoid the costly nursing expenses.},
