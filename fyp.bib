    abstract={Efficient and scalable simultaneous interaction between many web servers requires special handling of such
        interaction. Google Datastore provides highly available and reliable distributed storage and access on different
        types of data. With the rapid growth of distributed systems, efficient data provide is of critical
        importance. In this paper we present the possibilities which Google Application Engine and cloud computing
        provides to build distributed applications by specifically discussing the options to store the data on the
        cloud in a reliable way. Important is identification of the programming languages and tools which are
        suitable for designing of distributed systems using the Google possibilities as a framework for developing
        such systems. The design of distributed systems by using Google features together with the libraries in Java
        and Python programming language are examined in this paper.},

Detected signals and information were transmitted to home gateway and home server through Zigbee communication technology.

abstract={This paper discusses health monitoring of security proper ties, that is, software properties the violation of which might indicate that a vulnerability in the software is being attacked. Because malicious attackers may try to hide their presence from a health monitor, such monitoring has to be fine-grained - we will argue that individual instructions in the binary executable code should be monitored. This can be prohibitively expensive, but it may be possible to use static verification technology to reduce the workload of the health monitor. The paper discusses the possibilities of such a synthesis between static verification and runtime supervision.},

abstract={We have demonstrated two important things thus far. The first is that while a bottom-up approach to the development of a health monitor system may yield a health monitor hardware or software that is used to instantiate a system. They will become more system that produces some useful assurances to the system, it is not possible to prove that such a solution is a closed-form, tractable solution for any reasonably complex system. Health monitor systems that have been developed in the past using this technique have, therefore, been difficult to extend or embed in existing systems and it has been difficult to determine when the health monitor is completed. However, they have proven to be quite effective in the limited scope that they address within the operation of the system. This is important, because it demonstrates health monitoring technology in use.},

abstract={Web Services are internet enabled software components. By composing web services we can provide integration of Enterprise applications. Web Services are being used extensively by many enterprises like IBM, Microsoft and oracle every day. SOAP and REST are very popular types of web services. A Hospital Management Application is implemented as a web service that can perform functions like online appointment booking, preparing a prescription online, online room reservation, storing patient's medical history etc. The login forms of this application are made secured by computing the digest of the login details. The application is designed and developed using Eclipse, Google SQL cloud and Google App Engine. The application designed and developed is deployed to the Google App Engine to make it available online and to facilitate online transactions via the internet. The scalability test of the cloud enabled hospital management system has also been done using a custom developed software tool.},

abstract={This paper presents a survey on the timing performance of Google Cloud Messaging (GCM). We evaluate GCM in real world experiments, and at a reasonable scale involving thousands of real users. Our findings reveal that the GCM message delivery is unpredictable, namely having a reliable connection to Google's GCM servers on the client device does not guarantee a timely message arrival. Therefore, GCM is not suitable for time sensitive and/or "must-deliver-to-all" app scenarios. On the other hand, GCM delivers the push messages to a big portion of the subscribers (more than 40% in any experiment scenario) in a reasonable timeframe (in 10 seconds). Therefore, GCM may be a good fit for the application scenarios where random multicasting is sufficient, such as crowdsourcing systems. Our results provide a through evaluation of the GCM performance, and will guide developers and researchers to decide whether GCM is suitable for their intended use cases.},
