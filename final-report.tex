\section{Introduction} Along with the development of more compact and portable platform for measuring health related
data, there are many products on the market that are capable of reading and sending data to a computer system. These
devices are often built ready for communicating with mobile devices via Bluetooth to exchange data so that those data
can be displayed visually.  However, a universal platform to collect and display the data to users has not been
implemented yet. On the other hand, the measured data is not frequently recorded so that it can be used as reference in
diagnosing or study.  This project aims to implement such a platform with consideration on capability of adapting
multiple types of devices, data sharing as well as the scalability.  \section{Architecture design}
\label{sec:Architecture design}

\subsection{Client side}

The client is responsible for displaying the data acquired from the physical measuring devices visually as graph or
reading listing. The client is also capable of connecting to the back-end to interact with other users of the
application to share and access their data in the database. The users can subscribe to another user to view their data
and receive notifications upon certain events are triggered such as new data is uploaded or the reading is beyond safe
range.  The front-end part of the application is any mobile device with capability of sending HTTP request and receive
pushed messaging via Google Cloud Messaging. The client makes requests to the server via HTTP RESTful API calls and
receives HTTP responses.

\subsection{Server side}

The server is a Web server that exposes a RESTful API to the clients and serve the incoming requests. The server
interacts with a persistent database to run the application backend.To elevate scalability of the application, the
server side is decided to be run on Google App Engine, a cloud platform. By using Cloud computing for a credible service
provider, the application aims to minimize down-time and bottleneck comparing to hosting service on a single computer.
Moreover, Datastore database provided by Google also supports caching and reliably distributes data to different
locations with minimal latency.The web server is implemented in Java with Google Endpoints service. This helps promote
code reuse by sharing Java code between client and server codebase. In the future, the server can be swapped out by any
web server if there is need for finer control or performance improvement.

\subsection{Database}

App Engine Datastore is chosen to be the database backend of the system to reliably deliver data. App Engine Datastore
is a schema-less NoSQL data App Engine Datastore is chosen to be the database backend of the system to reliably deliver
data. App Engine Datastore is a schema-less NoSQL Datastore providing robust, reliable storage for the web
application.Comparing to the traditional relation databases, the Datastore uses a distributed architecture to
automatically managing scaling to very large data sets. Due to its different way of representing and managing data, the
Datastore can be easily scaled, allowing the application to maintain high performance as the traffic is increased.

\section{Work done so far} \label{sec:Work done so far} In the first half of the project, the basic application was
implemented on both server side and client side \subsection{Client side}

\begin{enumerate} \item Login of users using Google account.\item Displaying of numerical data with different choice of
view including by day, by week and by month.\item Displaying of numerical data from different users selectively.\item
Selectively fetching of new data from backend.\item Displaying of other users and subscription mechanics.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Server side}

\begin{enumerate} \item Implemented a RESTful API for different features on the application including:\item Subscribing
and Un-subscribing\item Posting and Retrieving of Data\item Register of new users and devices\item Sending Notification
messages to users via Google Cloud Messaging \end{enumerate}

\subsection{Android development practices}

In order to approach the latest change in new Android version and Android SDK, the project aims to use the latest tools
and practices suggested by Google. The client side application was made with consideration about design and components
choices.

\subsection{Software engineering practices}

Different standards in software engineering was considered and followed throughout the development of the application so
that the code can be read and reused by other developers.Serious consideration and effort has been put in the designing
the graph components such that the application can be easily extended to other types of data i.e. blood pressure, blood
sugar etc. as well as different ways of viewing data in the future.

\section{Future work} \label{sec:Work done so far}

Although the core codebase has been completed, there are space for improvement for this project.  \subsection{Features}

\begin{enumerate} \item Notifications pushing depending on the data flow to make the application more
user-friendlyImplementing display view of different types of data\item (Optional) Connecting with real measuring devices
to complete the full-stack solutionImplementation \end{enumerate}

\subsection{Implementation}

Fixing of remaining bugs in the application

\subsection{Software engineering practices} Refactor if necessary to have a clean and loosely coupled code base so that
it can be reused and integrated with other projects

\section{Conclusion} In conclusion, the core code base of the project has been completed but there are still features to
be implemented to provide a better interaction with the users.On the other hands, consideration in software engineering
practices and latest change of Android library is also required throughout the process of development for the rest of
the project.  \end{document}
